# Developer Portfolio

A professional portfolio site showcasing my work as a developer, built with intentionality and a narrative-driven approach to presenting technical projects.

## About This Site

This portfolio is designed to highlight my experience working across large and small teams, my systems thinking approach to problem solving, and my creative solutions to technical challenges. Rather than simply listing projects, each entry is structured as a case study that tells the story of the problem, the process, and the impact.

## Project Organization

The site is organized into several key sections:

- **Home**: A concise introduction and hero section
- **About**: Narrative overview of my background, values, and approach to development
- **Projects**: In-depth case studies of selected work, each including:
  - Context and challenge
  - My role and contributions
  - Outcomes and measurable impact
  - Lessons learned and reflections
- **Behind the Build**: Documentation of the architecture, design decisions, and development workflow for this portfolio itself
- **Future Interactive Demos**: Placeholder for Unity WebGL or other interactive showcases

## Tools and Technologies

This portfolio is built with a focused stack chosen for simplicity, performance, and maintainability:

- **Framework**: [Astro](https://astro.build) with Starlight theme for documentation-style structure
- **Hosting**: GitHub Pages (static site deployment)
- **Content**: Markdown/MDX
- **Development Environment**: Visual Studio Code
- **AI-Assisted Development**: GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4.5

The development process intentionally leverages AI tools (GitHub Copilot with Claude Sonnet 4.5) for boilerplate generation, component scaffolding, and refactoring suggestions, while keeping all architectural decisions and creative direction human-led. This workflow is documented as part of the "Behind the Build" section of the portfolio.

## Design Principles

- Clean, minimalist layout with strong typography
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Lightweight and fast performance
- Modular, reusable components
- Story-driven content structure
