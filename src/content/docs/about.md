# About Dave Stevens

## My Background

I've been building software for many years, working across a fascinating range of domains—from defense simulations at Lockheed Martin to entertainment apps at Microsoft, avatar systems at Meta, and game services at Bethesda. What drives me isn't just writing code, but understanding the full picture: the business challenge, the end-user experience, and the technical landscape needed to deliver real value.

## How I Work

### Systems Thinking

I approach problems holistically. Whether I'm architecting a cloud pipeline that needs to serve billions of users or optimizing a Unity app for low-end mobile devices, I consider the entire system—performance, maintainability, scalability, and team workflow.

### Leading and Contributing

I'm equally comfortable leading a team of 20+ engineers and diving deep into complex technical problems myself. At Meta, I led performance optimization efforts while also implementing critical code that achieved 40% faster load times. At Microsoft, I managed teams while staying hands-on with architecture decisions.

### Bridging Disciplines

Some of my most valuable work has been fostering communication between engineering, art, design, and backend teams. Technical artists and engineers speak different languages, but the best results come from true collaboration. I've built my career on being that bridge.

## Technical Focus Areas

- **Unity 3D Development**: Extensive experience across mobile, desktop, console, and VR platforms, including editor plugins and performance tools
- **Avatar Systems**: Deep expertise from Xbox Avatars and Meta Avatars to various avatar SDKs
- **Cloud Services**: Azure-based backends, CDNs, batch processing, and real-time rendering services
- **Performance Engineering**: CPU/memory optimization, profiling, and achieving aggressive performance targets
- **AI-Assisted Development**: Intentional use of Claude Sonnet 4.5 and GitHub Copilot to increase productivity while maintaining human-directed architecture

## Why I Do This

I love solving hard problems with smart people. The thrill of shipping something that millions will use, the satisfaction of unblocking a team with the right architecture decision, the challenge of hitting a seemingly impossible performance target—that's what keeps me engaged.

## Current Work

I'm currently a Principal Software Engineer at Jahnel Group, working with Bethesda Game Studios to build and maintain APIs that power mods, social features, and authentication across iconic games like Starfield, Skyrim, and Doom.

## Let's Connect

I'm always interested in discussing challenging technical problems, team dynamics, the game industry, or the evolving role of AI in software development.
