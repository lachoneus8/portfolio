# About

## The Short Version

I build systems that scale. Unity specialist who can also architect backends, optimize performance, and lead teams without losing track of what users actually need.

I've shipped to millions (Xbox, Meta, Microsoft) and worked with small teams (mid-sized companies, startups). The project size changes, but the approach doesn't: understand the real problem, build something that works, iterate until it's right.

## What I Actually Bring

### I See the Whole System

Whether it's a Unity app hitting performance walls or a backend service that needs to scale to millions, I look at the entire picture. Code, infrastructure, team workflow, user impact—it all matters.

### I Lead and I Build

Led teams of 20+ at Meta while still writing the critical performance code that shaved 40% off load times. At Microsoft, managed engineers while making architecture decisions. I don't just delegate—I roll up my sleeves.

### I Translate Between Humans

Engineers, artists, designers, product managers—everyone has their own language. Some of my best work has been getting these groups actually talking to each other. Technical artists and backend devs need a translator; I've done that job a lot.

## Tech I Use

- **Unity Everything**: Mobile, desktop, console, VR. Editor plugins, performance tools, avatar systems. If Unity runs it, I've probably shipped it.
- **Avatar Systems**: Xbox Avatars, Meta Avatars, various SDKs. I've built a lot of virtual humans.
- **Backend Services**: Azure pipelines, CDNs, batch processing, real-time rendering. Cloud stuff at scale.
- **Performance**: CPU profiling, memory optimization, making slow things fast.
- **AI Tools**: Claude and Copilot user. I automate the boring stuff so I can focus on interesting problems.

## Why This Work

Solving hard problems with smart people. Shipping something millions will use. Unblocking a team with the right call. Hitting an "impossible" performance target. That's the good stuff.

## Right Now

Principal Software Engineer at Jahnel Group, building APIs for Bethesda games (Starfield, Skyrim, Doom). Mods, social features, authentication—the infrastructure that lets players do cool stuff.
