## My Jam Games

Because sometimes the best way to stay sharp is to build something from scratch in 48 hours. All of these were built over a single weekend during game jams. No prep work, no assets ready beforehand—just a theme, a timer, and whatever we could pull together.

## Community Organizing

Beyond making games, I've run the Global Game Jam site at the Christa McAuliffe Space Center for **3 years running** (2024-2026).

**What that means:**

- Venue coordination and logistics
- Recruiting and supporting jammers
- Creating environment for teams to succeed under pressure
- Fostering local game dev community in Utah

## Why Game Jams Matter

Game jams keep skills sharp. When you've got 48 hours to go from concept to playable game, you learn what actually matters:

- **Scope ruthlessly**: Cut features until you have something shippable
- **Ship over polish**: Working beats perfect every time
- **Team sync**: Fast communication matters more than perfect architecture
- **Embrace constraints**: Limitations breed creativity

These aren't just fun weekend projects—they're practice for solving problems fast, which is exactly what professional game dev demands when you're up against a deadline.
