## Here's What I Actually Do

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="🎮 Unity Everywhere" icon="setting">
    Built production Unity apps across mobile, desktop, console, and VR. Editor
    plugins, performance tools, avatar systems—if Unity can run it, I've
    probably shipped it. Specific wins include Xbox Avatars (millions of users),
    and multiple apps for different teams, as well as long term dabbling as an 
	hobbyist indie dev.
  </Card>
  <Card title="⚡ Performance Obsession" icon="rocket">
    Shaved 40% off load times for Meta avatars. Profiled CPU, memory, asset
    pipelines until the numbers looked right. Keeping performance snappy makes
	users happier.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🔧 Full-Stack Problem Solver" icon="puzzle">
    Client apps, service backends, data pipelines—I build whatever solves the
    problem. Mobile to VR to cloud. Not religious about tech stacks, just what
    actually works.
  </Card>
  <Card title="👥 Team Translator" icon="group">
    I speak Engineer, Artist, Designer, and Product Manager. Led teams of 20+
    where half didn't write code. Getting everyone aligned is half the battle.
  </Card>
  <Card title="🤖 AI Power User" icon="star">
    Using Claude and GitHub Copilot to ship faster while keeping architectural
    decisions firmly human-directed. Built this entire portfolio site in days
    using AI tools. But architecture, user experience, and business decisions?
    That's still human work.

## Why People Hire Me

I solve problems. Not in a buzzword way—I mean I dig into the messy reality of what's actually broken, figure out what needs to happen, and ship it. Whether that's:

- **Seeing the Whole System**: Understanding how Unity client, backend services, and user needs all connect
- **Actually Communicating**: Making sure engineers understand artist workflows and artists understand technical constraints—finding solutions that work for both
- **Shipping at Scale**: Built stuff used by millions, while using my spare time to work in small teams
- **Moving Fast**: Using modern tools (AI, good automation) to iterate quickly without sacrificing quality
