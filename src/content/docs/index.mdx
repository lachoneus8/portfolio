## Here's What I Actually Do

<CardGrid stagger>
  <FlipCard 
    title="🎮 Unity Everywhere"
    frontContent="Built production Unity apps across mobile, desktop, console, and VR. Editor plugins, performance tools, avatar systems—if Unity can run it, I've probably shipped it."
    backContent="Specific wins: Xbox Avatars (millions of users), Meta Quest VR apps, mobile games hitting 60fps on mid-range devices. Built custom editor tools that cut artist iteration time by 50%. Shipped to iOS, Android, Xbox, Quest, and PC."
  />
  <FlipCard 
    title="⚡ Performance Obsession"
    frontContent="Shaved 40% off load times for Meta avatars. Profiled CPU, memory, asset pipelines until the numbers looked right. When users complain it's slow, I break out the profiler and fix it."
    backContent="Unity Profiler, Memory Profiler, and custom telemetry tools are my weapons. Reduced Meta avatar feature execution by 20%, optimized asset bundles, eliminated GC spikes. Users don't notice good performance—but they definitely notice bad performance."
  />
  <Card title="🔧 Full-Stack Problem Solver" icon="puzzle">
    Client apps, service backends, data pipelines—I build whatever solves the
    problem. Mobile to VR to cloud. Not religious about tech stacks, just what
    actually works.
  </Card>
  <Card title="👥 Team Translator" icon="group">
    I speak Engineer, Artist, Designer, and Product Manager. Led teams of 20+
    where half didn't write code. Getting everyone aligned is half the battle.
  </Card>
  <FlipCard 
    title="🤖 AI Power User"
    frontContent="Using Claude and GitHub Copilot to ship faster while keeping architectural decisions firmly human-directed. AI handles the tedious stuff so I can focus on the interesting problems."
    backContent="Built this entire portfolio site in days using Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Copilot. Use AI for code generation, documentation, data analysis, and test creation. But architecture, user experience, and business decisions? That's still human work."
  />
</CardGrid>

## Stuff I've Shipped

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Meta Avatars Platform" icon="user">
    Architected core pipeline for Meta Avatars used by over a billion users
    across Facebook, Instagram, and Quest. Led 20+ engineers to hit aggressive
    performance targets and represented team at Meta Connect 2024 launch.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Bethesda Game Services" icon="game-controller">
    Building APIs for mods, social experiences, and authentication across
    Bethesda titles like Starfield and Skyrim. Using AI-driven development tools
    to overhaul documentation and scale test data analysis.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Xbox Avatars System" icon="avatar">
    Built next-generation Xbox Avatars from the ground up, delivering Creative,
    Expressive, and Inclusive experiences with prosthetics, wheelchairs, hair
    physics, and maximum customization flexibility.
  </Card>

## Why People Hire Me

I solve problems. Not in a buzzword way—I mean I dig into the messy reality of what's actually broken, figure out what needs to happen, and ship it. Whether that's:

- **Seeing the Whole System**: Understanding how Unity client, backend services, and user needs all connect
- **Actually Communicating**: Translating between engineers who want clean architecture and artists who need it to work _now_
- **Shipping at Scale**: Built stuff used by millions, but I still remember what it's like to ship with a 3-person team
- **Moving Fast**: Using modern tools (AI, good automation) to iterate quickly without sacrificing quality
