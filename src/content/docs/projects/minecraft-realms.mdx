**Role:** Senior Software Engineer  
**Company:** Xbox Game Studios (Microsoft)  
**Timeline:** 2019-2021  
**Status:** Live (50M+ subscribers)  
**Platforms:** iOS, Android, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Windows  
**Tech Stack:** C++, Cross-platform UI, Multiplayer Infrastructure

## The Challenge

Minecraft needed to transition from one-time Realms purchases to an evergreen subscription service (Realms+) that provided continuous value through monthly content drops. This wasn't just a business model change—it required rethinking the entire player experience around discovery, onboarding, and ongoing engagement.

The system had to:

- Deliver compelling UX that communicated subscription value without overwhelming players
- Guide new mobile players through complex multiplayer concepts
- Maintain performance across all platforms despite added content delivery infrastructure
- Support seamless content updates without disrupting active gameplay sessions
- Scale to tens of millions of concurrent players across six platforms

This was about balancing player experience with technical constraints—making sophisticated systems feel simple.

## My Role & Contributions

**Provided UX engineering for Realms+ launch** and technical leadership for mobile in-game tutorials, while analyzing multiplayer performance at scale.

- **UX Engineering for Realms+ Launch:** Translated product vision into engineered experiences—designed and helped implement the subscription discovery flow, content marketplace UI, and onboarding sequences that balanced clarity with technical constraints
- **Mobile Tutorial Technical Leadership:** Led the team building in-game tutorial systems for mobile platforms, architecting reusable components that educated players without interrupting gameplay flow
- **Multiplayer Performance Analysis:** Deep profiling of multiplayer experiences across platforms to identify bottlenecks—focused on ensuring quality for shared infrastructure serving millions of concurrent players
- **Cross-Platform Coordination:** Partnered with platform teams (iOS, Android, Console) to ensure consistent UX despite different technical capabilities
- **Pragmatic Decision-Making:** Constantly balanced feature richness against performance and maintainability—shipped iteratively rather than waiting for perfect

## Technical Approach

Built UX-first engineering solutions that made complex multiplayer and subscription systems accessible to players of all ages and technical backgrounds.

**Core Focus Areas:**

- **Subscription UX Architecture:** Assisted with designing the flow from discovery → trial → subscription → content delivery, ensuring each step communicated value clearly while handling edge cases (expired subs, failed payments, parental controls)

  />
</div>

- **Mobile Tutorial System:** Reviewed all code and provided technical guidance to the team building reusable tutorial components using C++ that could be configured by designers without code changes—tooltips, highlight overlays, step-by-step flows that adapted to player actions in real-time

- **Performance at Scale:** Analyzed multiplayer server load patterns, client network performance, and UI responsiveness to maintain quality as player base scaled into tens of millions

**Key Technical Decisions:\*\***

- **Iterative UX launches:** Rather than ship everything at once, we launched core subscription flow first, then layered in discovery features based on player behavior data
- **Graceful degradation:** Content delivery failures never blocked gameplay—players could always access their subscribed content, even if marketplace had issues

## Results & Impact

- **Successful launch:** Realms+ subscription service launched across all platforms, reaching 50M+ subscribers
- **Mobile onboarding improvement:** Tutorial system reduced mobile player drop-off as they learned to play in-game
- **Performance optimization:** Identified multiplayer bottlenecks and provided insights that enabled infrastructure improvements to support higher player counts
