## Experience

### Jahnel Group, Lehi, UT

**Principal Software Engineer** | May 2025 – Present

Working as an engineer for Zenimax/Bethesda Game Studios as a team supplement from Jahnel Group. Helping to build the set of APIs used for supporting mods, social experiences, authentication across many systems, and other services that bring value to gamers playing Bethesda Game Studios or id games such as Starfield, Skyrim, or Doom.

- Using Claude 4.0 agent based development tools through GitHub Copilot to dramatically increase productivity. This includes using these tools for overhauling documentation for our extensive set of APIs, making them easier to understand across the board.
- Using the same AI based development tools to help increase the visibility into our extensive test data, leading to actionable insights to improve quality. We support a broad range of platforms, across a range of service environments, with hundreds of integrated tests run through each. This results in a large amount of data to process to determine viable insights on health of our systems. I took existing tools that provided a small amount of capable insights, but scaled them up tremendously, using AI data analysis best practices, resulting in dashboards and messaging that calls out health and allows deep dives to determine any issues.
- Architected and built the API front end for an unannounced service with heavy back end requirements. Participated in early research for the set of features, and directly with those building the back end, adding extensive integrated tests along the way.

Represented the entire team in preparation for launch readiness for a massive release at Meta Connect in fall 2024. Supported the launch as oncall, fixing more than my fair share of issues as they arose while also using defensive programming to avoid future issues, which resulted in a very smooth launch. 100s of millions of users used the new Meta avatars in the first few months. Used Meta's Llama based coding assistance tools extensively as part of this effort.
- Spearheaded a team of over 20 engineers and technical artists to hit aggressive performance targets, interfaced with other teams on goals, provided continued support in measurement and deep dives of CPU and memory usage, and implemented some of the key tasks needed to hit these targets. This included one that resulted in 20% reduction of time to change avatar features, and another one that reduced initial load execution time by 40%. Improved experience performance on Android devices, Quest, Windows workstation tools, and cloud services.
- Led a team of contractors to build the bulk of the processing building blocks used to generate the new avatar system (graph-based architecture). Acted as the engineering owner of this initiative with, ensuring the means for backward compatibility and versioning and implementing some of the most complex code.
